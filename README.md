## Diabetes Prediction
Diabetes Prediction is the project I have done during my Artificial Intelligence internship at CodeClause.

🔍 **Objective:** Predict the likelihood of diabetes based on relevant health indicators.

🛠 **Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

📝 **Description:**
Implemented a classification model to predict the likelihood of diabetes using a dataset with health indicators. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), handled missing data, and trained a model for accurate predictions.
